       These are some tips on how you can remain safe on social media:
    </br>

    Oversharing information is  the biggest risk  and mistake people do  when on social media, the ways in which it can be harmful are numerous.  Potential burglars are always watching for people on vacation, hackers are looking for information they can use to break into your accounts, scammers are looking for vulnerable people to swindle, and identity thieves are searching for easy targets.  There are many other examples, but the root issue is the same – too much information is available to people who shouldn’t necessarily have access

the problem is created by people posting without knowing all the facts in a given situation.  It’s important to be cautious of your actions online, so that you don’t contribute to such a problem, or become a victim.

<br>Here are some tips to be more secure while using social media:<br>
	Use the two-factor authentication and strong passwords to secure your logins onto social media.Two-factor authentication will make it much more difficult for hackers to take over your accounts.<br>
	Before entrusting your information on  any website or social media platform you need to verify  if ts secure ,Imposter profiles are a huge problem for social media platforms, related to identity theft and online harassment.<br>
	Don’t lie, harass, abuse, intimidate, or threaten people on social media.  It may seem like common sense, but you can open yourself up to legal issues, criminal charges, or accusations of cyberbullying.  Social media sites prohibit these types of behavior, anyway.<br>


	Be carefull of  the apps (quizzes& games) that you allow to link to your social media.  These apps may be gathering personal information about you, beyond just your email address.<br>
	If you  planning on  having a profile open to the public for blogging, or building a professional presence online, create a different profile for personal use.  Lock the personal profiles down, and don’t mix up the content between the two, ever. <br>
	Don’t accept any requests or messages from strangers. You are not only allowing strangers to see your information, but to access peoples information on your network.  Messages sent in social media platforms can carry malicious links or attachments, just like phishing emails do.  <br>
	Potential  employers check your social media profiles before hiring so be careful of the content you post because the  monitor for violations of their policy<br>
	Read the privacy policy and terms of service for the social media site.  You may be surprised at what the site is allowed to do with your information, pictures and other data.  If you decide that giving up some control of your data is worth using the site, that’s fine, but you may want to restrict your posts and activities even further.<br>
	Turn off location services when you post on your social media.  You are pin pointing your location in real-time if you don’t disable GPS/location services.  Depending on the privacy controls of people you’re connected to, people outside your network might be able to see information that you don’t want them to.<br>
	Be careful about what you make visible to your network, but especially what you make public.  You shouldn’t make the name of your high school, your birthdate, your address, your children’s or pets’ names, or other personal information public.
  Many times, this information is used by scammers to pretend to be someone you know, or by hackers trying to force password resets on accounts.  And, while it may be obvious, do not post social security numbers, credit card numbers, account numbers or other types of confidential/financial information.<br>
	Install an antivirus program, and run daily updates and scans and Encrypt the device and any storage cards that are in it.<br>
	Always hover over links included in the emails to see where they will take you.<br>
