            <h2> Disadvantages using of Social Media in seniors/old people </h2>
            <hr>


            <p>
                <b>1. Internet addictions </b>
                The growth of internet addiction is one of the detrimental effects of social media on elders. In a true sense, keeping elderly confined to their homes would be an issue. It has been discovered that some people indulge in online behaviours that lead to divorce. Internet addictions are a huge problem for families. Even though the likelihood of reaching out to others grows, being able to interact with individuals in the community is still crucial.
                A senior may lose sight of the importance of the actual world nearby if he or she spends too much time indoors and prefers to stay online on Twitter and Facebook to increase the number of followers and start conversations. It would be preferable if the seniors could participate in the social gatherings as well. 
                The importance of physical activity cannot be overstated, as even the elderly and less mobile individuals require movement in order to preserve their health. As people become more addicted to their devices, they risk missing out on opportunities to be physically active. 
                <br>
                <b>2. Fraud </b>
                <br>  
                This is one of the most common crimes in the world. Fraud is rampant even among social media users. The majority of the elderly who work in technology do not understand the importance of protecting themselves against fraudsters and hackers. This puts them at risk of falling prey to social media scammers. Older individuals can be vulnerable and powerless at times. Scammers take advantage of a number of programs, strategies, and equipment to defraud these elderly people. 
                <br>
                <b>3. Privacy </b>  
                <br>
                The use of social media by seniors is accompanied with concerns about personal information being exposed on these platforms. Some people may be unaware of the risks of sharing personal information on social media platforms. Because some consumers are unaware of the privacy and license terms on many websites, they may give harmful parties access to their personal information.  In some cases, this may lead to them becoming victims of cybercrime. 
               <br>
               <b> 4. Harassment and Bullying on social media   </b>  
              <br>
                Another negative effect of social media on seniors is this. These kind of crimes target unsuspecting elder persons and are generally carried out by cruel teenagers who make derogatory remarks about them on social media.
                The elders are being shown that they are beyond the age of social media and that they do not belong there. Bullying of this nature disturbs the elderly and has a psychological impact on them.</p>

        <h2> Disadvantages of Social Media in local businesses</h2>
<hr>
           
        <p> While marketing gurus frequently tout social media as a crucial marketing tool for all types of organizations, they rarely acknowledge that it also has drawbacks. While social media can be a great tool for personal relationships, such as keeping friends in touch, it can also be a can of worms when it comes to business. 
            <br>
        <b>Labour and time intensive</b>
            <br>
            The main disadvantage of social networking is that it consumes a significant amount of your time and effort. This is because on social media platforms, consistency is crucial. Ideally, you should post multiple times every day, but at the very least once. While writing a post shouldn't take more than five minutes, the thinking time and follow-ups you'll need to undertake can take much longer. This time is doubled if you have social media profiles on many sites, all of which must always be maintained. This is time that may be better spent producing leads or running your firm. 
            <br>
            <b>Perception of intrusion</b>
            <br>
            Some people consider social media to be a personal environment, and they do not enjoy being targeted by businesses just interested in their money. These consumers are also hesitant to provide personal information on social media, and any company that collects information in this manner risks becoming embroiled in a privacy dispute.
            <br>
            <b>Lack of censorship</b>
            <br>
            Negative reviews or feedback posted on business pages by social media users cannot be blocked or suppressed. If not handled appropriately, this could harm your company's brand. Any attempt to respond negatively, as numerous organizations have discovered to their dismay, can result in a backlash, just as failure to reply can reflect apathy or bad customer service. Companies must examine their business sites on social media platforms on a regular basis to ensure they remain on top of bad criticism, which may be time- and labour-intensive.
            <br>

            
            <b>Existing client base</b>
            <br>
            The third disadvantage of social media marketing is that many of your followers are established customers who are likely to return regardless of your social media activities. On social media, engaging with potential new clients is significantly more challenging, and you may have to rely on referrals from your existing client base. Social media can be a wonderful and economical tool for small business marketing, but it can also be a liability in terms of the dedication required to make it a success. Work out whether you can afford the time and labour to maintain a consistent and profitable social media presence or whether you would do better to avoid it.

    <b> Conclusionin negitive effect </b>
    <BR>
    Social media leaves  lasting effect  on users, particularly the younger generations, social networks face an unclear future. Because they are terrified of cyberbullying, families panic when their children visit social media websites for the first time and discover about their presence on these platforms. They don't want their kids to be catfished by either a stranger on Internet when they're not around.

    Furthermore, social media platforms are the source of countless individuals' losing  sensitive data being lost to corporations every day. These companies are exploiting the information to bombard consumers with advertisements for products they do not wish to buy. If such incidents continue, the day will come when the government will begin to monitor social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others. Massive surveillance will be placed on these sites to prevent malevolent minds from physically injuring or hacking into the systems of innocent teenagers.
<br>
